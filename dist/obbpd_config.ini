# turbo_mode (Explanation below)

# Enables faster testing by reducing delays between actions.
# - Speeds up checks for whether the game has launched or crashed.
# - Reduces wait time after launching the game (from 0.5s to 0.2s).
# - Speeds up resume polling when paused (from 0.1s to 0.05s).
# - Still respects 'after_close_delay' but shortens other delays.
# Recommended if your system loads the game quickly and reliably.
# Set to true for faster testing, false for more stability.
