The plugin counter “Remaining” does not update properly (FIXED V1.2)

Turbo batching mode fully ready (COMPLETED V2.0)

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Virus Scanner False Positives
OBBPD v2.0 is a custom-built EXE.
Some antivirus or security software may flag it as suspicious or a “generic trojan” due to its automation, scripting, and ability to launch external programs for game testing.
This is a known and common issue with small-batch EXE tools built with PyInstaller and similar utilities.
OBBPD does NOT contain any malicious code.
If you downloaded it from the official source or directly from Nicholas Parfitt, you can safely whitelist it in your antivirus.

🚀 What is OBBPD?
OBBPD stands for Oblivion Broken Batch Plugin Detector.
It helps Oblivion Remastered players and modders automatically and quickly find which .esp or .esm files are crashing their game—even in huge modlists.

How it works:
Tests your load order in automated batches

Detects crashes at launch

Narrows down broken plugins

Quarantines or comments out problem files

Rebuilds your load order with only safe mods

🆕 What’s New in v2.0?
Turbo Batch Mode
Super-fast troubleshooting! When a plugin crashes, it’s removed and a mega-batch of all remaining plugins is attempted. Ends early if possible.

Core Plugins Always Passed
All required and optional plugins (set in the config) are always listed as “passed” if they pass the initial check.

Smarter Patch/Fix Handling
Patch/fix/compatibility plugins are tested after the main mods, so load order is correct.

Improved Session Folders
Every run creates timestamped backup, log, and quarantine folders for easy reverts and history.

Enhanced Logging & UI
Full logs, grouped and timestamped. Three-column fullscreen UI (Testing | Passed | Failed) with batch progress.

Fully Configurable
All key options (batch size, turbo, plugins, display) are controlled in obbpd_config.ini.

🧰 Requirements
Windows 10 or 11

OBSE64 (Oblivion Script Extender 64-bit) installed

OblivionRemastered-Win64-Shipping.exe

A valid plugins.txt (not overwritten by Vortex during testing)

🛠 How It Works
Backup and Restore

Backs up your current plugins.txt before any changes

Restore original load order any time

Sanity Check

Tests all required and optional plugins first

Any crash here means a core mod or patch is broken

Batch & Turbo Batch Testing

Standard Mode: Plugins are tested in batches (batch size in config). If a batch fails, it’s split or tested individually.

Turbo Batch Mode: As soon as a plugin fails, it’s removed and a mega-batch is attempted with all remaining plugins. If it passes, you’re done!

Patch/Fix Plugins

Patch/fix/compatibility plugins are tested after main mods to keep load order stable.

Quarantine and Final Load Order

Broken plugins are moved to Quarantine (session folder) or commented out in plugins.txt with a timestamp and “REMOVED BY OBBPD”.

📁 Folder Structure
Each session creates subfolders for perfect organization:

Backups/session_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS — Original plugins.txt

Logs/session_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS — Batch/test logs

Quarantine/session_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS — Broken .esp/.esm files

⚙ Configuration (obbpd_config.ini)
Example:

[CorePlugins]
required = Oblivion.esm, DLCBattlehornCastle.esp, DLCFrostcrag.esp, DLCHorseArmor.esp, DLCMehrunesRazor.esp, DLCOrrery.esp, DLCShiveringIsles.esp, DLCSpellTomes.esp, DLCThievesDen.esp, DLCVileLair.esp, Knights.esp, AltarESPMain.esp, AltarDeluxe.esp
optional = Unofficial Oblivion Remastered Patch.esp, Unofficial Oblivion Remastered Patch - Deluxe.esp

[Settings]
wait_seconds = 10
after_close_delay = 2
batch_size = 50
truncate_length = 25
turbo_mode = False
turbo_batch_mode = True

🖥️ UI & Controls
Display:
Fullscreen, three columns:

Testing

Recently Passed

Failed

Shows batch progress, stats, and current batch size.

While testing:

Press any key to pause

R: Resume

V: Revert to original load order and quit

Q: Quit and keep current state

📝 plugins.txt Output Example
Vortex-compatible formatting.

Required and optional files always at the top

All safe plugins listed in load order

Broken plugins commented out with timestamp and “REMOVED BY OBBPD”

Example:

##OBBPD ENFORCED ORDER (2025-06-07 18:00:00)##

Oblivion.esm
DLCShiveringIsles.esp
BetterCities.esp

##REMOVED PLUGINS##
#BrokenFollower.esp #REMOVED BY OBBPD (2025-06-07 18:00:00)
📋 End-of-Run Summary
At the end of each session, OBBPD will:

Show total passed, failed, and remaining plugins

Offer to quarantine failed files, restore the original plugin list, or exit and keep the new load order

Save logs and session states to subfolders

🛑 Vortex Users Note
If you use Vortex:

Vortex will overwrite plugins.txt!

To use OBBPD safely:

Temporarily disable Vortex’s deployment/auto-deploy

Run Oblivion directly (not from Vortex) using OBSE64

Let OBBPD finish, then manually import your plugins.txt back into Vortex

❓ Troubleshooting
Game won’t launch?
Check your game path and required plugins. OBSE64 must be used.

Script exits early?
A required plugin is missing or broken.

No plugins tested?
Make sure your plugins.txt has enabled (non-comment) lines.

Game keeps reverting/crashing?
Run LOOT before and after making changes in Vortex.
Vortex will notify you after re-deploying that files have been removed after OBBPD has quarantined bad plugins. This is normal—always disable breaking mods in Vortex before moving forward.
